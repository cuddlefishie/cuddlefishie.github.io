# Resources for proper dwarf hamster care

Dwarf hamsters are super cute, but most guides give really bad suggestions for their needs.

Here some general guidelines first, then we'll look at cages, interior decoration and food.

## Some guidelines for hamster care

Hamsters are loners, don't keep more than one! They are doing fine alone :) In fact, hamsters can get pretty brutal when they are kept in company for too long..

Hamsters are clumsy and don't have a feeling for height (they live on the ground or underground in the wild). So the **maximum fall height anywhere in the cage should not be more than 10cm**.

When hamsters are in danger they **try to flee**. This is important to know, because if you have some items in the cage where your hamster can get the hands or feet stuck in, they might panic and **gnaw off their body parts to escape!** There is no danger your cage, but to avoid those situations, make sure they can't get stuck. That means any bridges or hideouts can't have too wide gaps or be made of material where their paws can get stuck.

## The cage

You should use something made out of glass or glass-like plastic. **Avoid cages made out of wires**.
The cage should be **at least 100x50x50 cm** (40" x 20" x 20").

For example, here is one in that size: [amazon link](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00I4XMPVM)).
Or [another one](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01HMLFYWS/) or [another one](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BRB6HMDZ/)

## The interior decoration

First things first, do not use any objects in the cage that are made of softwood. **Do not use sooftwood, instead use birch, poplar or beech!**. Softwood contains oils that are toxic to most animals, including hamsters!!

Also **any heavy objects must be standing on pillars or otherwise secured!!**. Hamsters like to dig tunnels, if they dig under a heavy object, the tunnel might give in and the hamster could still be inside!

The things you can buy in most pet stores might just say "natural wood", then they are probably made of softwood. So it's probably better to buy online than in local stores!

**The essentials you will need:**
- good bedding
- running wheel
- sand bath
- chambered house
- hiding spaces
- Other "fun stuff"
- drinking- and fresh-food bowls

### Bedding

Dwarf hamsters like to dig tunnels! Well, some do, some don't, but in nature, they are excellent tunnel diggers. So you should fill your cage with **at least 25cm of bedding** (10"). So your cage will be **filled up halfway with bedding**.

Try to find **de-dusted wooden bedding** if possible (not softwood) or **hemp bedding**.

You generally want to mix your bedding a little bith with other things, more on that later!

### The wheel

For a dwarf hamster, the wheel should have an **inside-diameter of at least 26cm** (10"). Yes it's massive, but hamster run A LOT, giving them good posture is really important. Also a high quality wheel will be quiet and not annoy you as much either :P

I can recommend [this wheel](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01M4ONNXX).

### Sand bath

Hamsters bathe in sand to keep themselves clean (and I guess it's fun too!).

For that they need a big enough sand bath in their cage. The sand bath should be at least **20cm x 20 cm x 8cm** (~8" x ~8" x ~3.5"). It should be filled with **Chinchilla bath sand**. The sand is probably one of the few things you can find in your local store!

Here is the sand bath I use: [link](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B078MRSBJP).

The nice thing about this one is that you can place the wheel on top of it, then you don't need to secure the wheel separately!

### Chambered house

In the wild hamsters also dig chambered tunnels, some of which they sleep in, some they store food in etc.

The chambered house should have **at least 3 chambers**. Again, make sure it's not made of softwood! The **top should be removable**. Because hamsters like to stash food, it's good to have easy access to remove fresh food before it starts rotting.

### Hiding spaces

Here you can get creative :)

A hamster should have at least three hiding places. You can buy ceramic houses, houses out of wood, pieces of cork etc. Just make sure they can't get stuck and the material is safe!

Also if the hide-out is too heavy, make sure to support them with pillars.

You can fill one of the hideouts with **maize-granulate, which they can use to do their own mani- and pedicure!**

### Other fun stuff

You can get twigs or tunnels (some hamsters dig tunnels themselves, so they might not really use them at all), again just make sure they are safe, but if they can provide enrichment for your hamster, that's great :)

### Drinking and fresh-food bowls

Because in the wild hamsters drink from ponds they should have a **small drinking bowl**! Drinking bottles require bad posture for drinking!

I use tiny tea-light holders made of glass. Like those:

You can also use those (or bigger ceramic bowls) for giving your hamster some fresh food! More on that later!
